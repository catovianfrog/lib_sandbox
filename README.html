<h1>TOKENIZE</h1>

<h2>String parsing for words or quoted substrings</h2>

<p><em>v3.2</em></p>

<p>22.06.2014    </p>

<p>This function splits a string into words or substrings.
This is a small exercise to learn C. The same function in Perl would probably
take only a couple of lines of code. </p>

<p><em>Tokenize</em> returns an array of strings pointing to the words in the input buffer. The number of strings
is returned as an *int parameter passed by reference.</p>

<p>Note that the source string <strong>buffer</strong> (<em>*buf</em>) <strong>is modified:</strong> a null character is inserted at the end of each word or quoted string.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>char**    <strong>tokenize</strong>(<em>char</em> *buffer, <em>int</em> *word_count);</p>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<ul>
<li>nil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Log History</h3>

<ul>
<li>v3  Prints error message on stderr and returns non-zero when syntax error (uneven number of quotes, or quotes within words)</li>
<li>v2  Memory allocation cleaned up. Doesn't allocate memory to returned strings, but return pointers to 
strings in input buffer. Input puffer is modified with end-of-strins characters.</li>
<li>v1  works, but memory almlocation is a mess</li>
</ul>
